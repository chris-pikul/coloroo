     * - `#FFAA00`: Long-form, byte values for the RGB channels.
     * - `#FFAA0088`: Long-form, byte values for the RGB and Alpha channels.
     *
     * ### Functional-notation
     * Uses the {@link ColorRGB.fromFunctional} method to parse as a
     * functional notation string in the style of CSS4, with some forgiveness.
     * Will accept either 3-component for RGB, or 4-component for RGBA. Each
     * parameter can be either an integer, float, or percentage value which will
     * be converted as appropriate for the channel.
     *
     * Example formats accepted.
     * ```

     * - `number`: Will be treated as a 32-bit integer and use
     * {@link ColorRGB.fromInteger}.
     * - `string`: Can be either a hexidecimal string (ex. "#FFAA88"), a

     * `rgba(255, 127, 64)`), an X11 named color (ex. "gold"), or the keyword
     * "transparent" for a fully-transparent black color. Internally uses the
     * {@link ColorRGB.fromString} function.
     * - `array`: An array of RGB(A) component values, either as numbers, or as
     * strings that can be parsed into numbers (such as percentages, or the
     * "none" keyword). It does not need to contain all the channels, any missing
     * will be skipped and remain at their defaults. Internally uses the
     * {@link ColorRGB.apply} function.
     * - `ColorRGB`: Each component will be copied as-is.
     * - `IColor` or an object having `toRGB()`: Will use the `toRGB()` function
     * and copy each channel component as-is.
     * - `object`: Any object that has any of the following properties available:
     *   - `r` or `red`: Byte value for red channel
     *   - `g` or `green`: Byte value for green channel
     *   - `b` or `blue`: Byte value for blue channel
     *   - `a` or `alpha` or `opacity`: Unit number (0..1) for alpha channel
     *
     * If multiple arguments are supplied they are treated as R, G, B, and A. If
     * all the values are numbers they are clamped to 0..1 and applied as they
     * are. Otherwise, mixed values use the {@link ColorRGB.apply} function.
     *
     * Examples of usage:
     * ```
     * new ColorRGB() // Default black color
     * new ColorRGB(1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5) // Color from channels
     * new ColorRGB(0xFFAA88)   // Color from integer
     * new ColorRGB('gold')     // Color from X11 named color
     * new ColorRGB('#FFAA88')  // Color from hexidecimal string
     * new ColorRGB('rgb(255, 127, 64)')  // Color from functional-notation
     * new ColorRGB([1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.5])  // Color from array of numbers
     * new ColorRGB(['100%', '50%', 'none', '50%']) // Color from array of strings
     * new ColorRGB({ r: 255, g: 127, b: 64}) // Color from object
